 * A thread-safe container that stores a group ID and members.

 * This class is called many times, so it should have a good performance.

 * Example usage:
 * <p>
 * DisappointingGroup group = new DisappointingGroup("group-001");
 * <p>
 * group.addMember(new DisappointingGroup.Member("member-100", 42));
 * group.addMember(new DisappointingGroup.AdminMember("admin-999", 30));
 * group.addMember(new DisappointingGroup.Member("member-321", 15));
